The 2008 Koenigsegg CCXR Edition is a special variant of the Koenigsegg CCXR that was introduced in 2007.
The same twin-supercharged V8 engine fitted into the CCX is also placed into the CCXR Edition. The only alterations made to the engine include modified fuel injectors, an upgraded fuel line, higher boost superchargers and a set of upgraded piston rings.

The CCXR Edition's exterior is comprised of unpainted carbon-fibre. The CCXR Edition is more powerful than the standard CCXR due to the ignition timing enabled by ethanol.

It also features a unpainted carbon-fibre body, polished aluminium Edition wheels for optimum brake cooling, a front splitter, side strakes and a rear spoiler.
